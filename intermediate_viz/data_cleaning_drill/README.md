### Welcome Trust Open-Access Funding Between 2012-2013

Data in their natural form rarely come sqeaky-clean. Often time they are passed through the 'laundary machine' that ride them of all impurities before they can be analysed and meaning insight drawn from them. The Laundary machine are the various techniques employed to clean and purify the data of all impurities and dirt.

In this prolect we used some of those techniques.

The data set is about the open-access prices paid by the [WELCOME Trust between 2012 and 2013]('https://www.dropbox.com/s/19cjdi7wqhlfcpt/WELLCOME.zip?dl=0')

The dataset contains the following elements:
* **PMC ID/PMID**
To help the Trust identify whether a work is in PMC/Europe PMC, we ask institutions to cite the PMC ID (or the PubMed ID if a PMC ID is not known.  This data is  not always 100% accurate.
* **Publisher**
This lists the name of the publisher, as reported by the institution.  As we do not impose any name authority control on this field, you will see the same publisher listed in different ways.  For example, OUP, Oxford University Press, and O.U.P.
* **Journal name**
This lists the name of the journal (which published the Wellcome-funded work), as reported by the institution.  Again, as we not impose any name authority control on this, you will see the same journal listed in different ways.  For example, PNAS, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, P.N.A.S.
Article title
This is the title of the article, as reported by the institution.
* **Cost**
The cost listed is the figure which the institution is claiming from the Wellcome Trust grant

Our objectives are:
* Determine the five most common journals and the total articles for each
* Calculate the mean, median and standard deviation of the open-access cost per article for each journal
