    "## Research Proposal (A/B Test)\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Introduction and Statement of Problem \n",
    "\n",
    "Our startup name is applyme. Applyme is rewriting the rule of  employment agency. Our business model is a total deviation from the convention of talent sourcing and head hunting.   Rather than jobseeker applying to jobs, our platform makes potential employers apply to you. In order words, our clients seeking to fill vacant positions with talented workers  browse profiles of jobseekers on our platform and when such profile meet their expectation, they apply directly to this profile by clicking 'come work for us'. Through this platform applyme plaform is able to link jobseeker with potential employers\n",
    "\n",
    "For some time now,the steam is cooling off on us and we would like to subject our suspicions to imperical test. To this end we would utilized the A/B testing methodology. We seek to introduce the linkedin emb unto the profile page of employees on our platform as we believe that profile with the linkedin emb would be more acessible and gain more viscibility amongst our clients, who are invariably the potential employers of the employees on our platfirm. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal in this test is to quantify the impact of the linkedin embeded on the profile page of employees on the applyme platform.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "We expect that: \n",
    "* Employees that have the linkedin embeded on their profile page would be more visible to employers than those that do not.\n",
    "* Employees that have the linkedin embeded on their profile stand a better chance of being invited for interview than those that do not. \n",
    "* Employees that have the linkedin embeded on their profile stand a better chance of getting jobs and employemnt letters than those that don not.\n",
    "for the above hypothesis to be usefull they have to be rigorously tested and measured.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Method of testing the solution\n",
    "\n",
    "There would be two groups/version of our platform: one group would bear the Linkedin embed on the profile page of job seekers whereas the other group would not have the Linkedin embed on the individual profile page of the job seekers.Similarly we would have two samples groups of subscribers of the *applyme* platform on the ratio od 50:50. The two sample group would be drawn ramdomly from  the pool of the total subscribers who are invariably potential employers of the *jobseekers* on our *applyme* platform.\n",
    "One of group of the sample of   would see the version of our platform where the profile of each job seekers do not have the Linkedin embed on their profile page whereas the other group sample group od subscriber would see only ther version of our platform where the individual pages of jobseekers have the Linkedin embed on their profile page.\n",
    "\n",
    "This test would be carried out for six months. The basis upon which we would determine success  would be the *T-test* with a p value  < 0.05 .In otherwords the success metrics would be T-test with a p value < 0.05 . Consequently we expect jobseekers with the linkedin embed on their profile page to receive employment letters than job seekers without the linkedin embed on their profile. Under this condition we would reject the null hypothesis which surmise there is no difference between the profile of jobseeker with the linkedin emded on their profile\n",
    "\n",
    "If the  average result shows an increase in the nunbers of jobseekers with the linkedin embed getting more chances of employment than jobseejers without the linkedin embed we would uprade our platform so that all jobseeker must have the linkedin emded on their individual profile subsequently.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Disclaimer on Analysis of data set\n",
    "For the purpose of simulating the analysis part of this test, we would assume that the data set was collected twice. The first part would be analysed with data when the test was in progress and the other part of the data set would be the full version od the data set upon completion of the experiment \n",
